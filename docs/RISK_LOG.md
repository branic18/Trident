# 75HER Challenge: Risk Log Template
Project Name: [Insert Project Name]
Team Name: [Insert Team Name]

## 💡 Purpose & Instructions
Purpose: Track issues you identified and fixed during development. This demonstrates proactive problem-solving and critical thinking to judges.
Instructions: Document risks as you find them during the hackathon.
Categorize each by severity (Critical, Major, or Minor).
Clearly show how you resolved them with evidence.
Target: Document at least 3 risks you found and fixed.

## 🔴 Severity Levels
Critical (Red): Blocks submission. Includes exposed API keys, fabricated claims, IP violations, or a broken demo.
Major (Orange): Must fix before final submission. Includes missing citations, accessibility violations, or broken links.
Minor (Yellow): Document and fix if time permits. Includes minor typos or UI polish.

✅ Fixed


## 🚩 Risk Categories to Monitor
Accuracy & Verifiability: Are claims backed by credible sources?
Privacy & Security: No exposed API keys or PII (Personally Identifiable Information).
Ethics & DEI: Use of inclusive language and representative examples.
Legal/IP & Licensing: Proper licenses for libraries and attribution for assets.
Accessibility: Alt text on images and WCAG AA color contrast (4.5:1).
Operational: The demo runs from a fresh clone and all links work.

## ✅ Self-Red-Team Checklist
Run this check 48 hours before submission!
### Privacy & Security
- [ ] No API keys, passwords, or tokens in code.
- [ ] .env.example file included with dummy values.
- [ ] No real user data (emails/names) in screenshots or demos.
### Accuracy & Sources
- [ ] All statistics have source citations in the Evidence Log.
- [ ] Data visualizations show real or clearly labeled synthetic data.
### Legal & IP
- [ ] LICENSE file present and all dependencies listed.
- [ ] No unauthorized logos or trademarks used.
### Accessibility

🏆 Tips for a Strong Risk Log
Be Honest: Judges respect transparency regarding the issues you caught.
Provide Evidence: Document fixes with specific file names or line numbers.
Update Regularly: Check this list weekly during development (Days 51-70).
Don't Claim Zero Risks: It is not credible to have found no risks during a project.
